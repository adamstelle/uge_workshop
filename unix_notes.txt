UNIX Philosophy: key elements to modern UNIX coding are:
- Human readable plan text 
- Nested subdirectories
- many small programs
- input-output redirection

UNIX Kernel: a program that manages the hardware
- Kernel is the layer btw other programs and hardware (e.g. CPU, Memory, Devices)

UNIX Shell: provide a user interface
- first command line
- next graphical user interface
- multi-touch user interface 
- audible user interface (e.g. Siri)

Terminal Notes
- “Path”: goes from broad to specific. absolute paths start with  / , relative (without /)
- “Root”: topmost container of the filing system - everything is contained within
- “flags”: modifiers on most commands (e.g. ls -t). Can also combine flags.  
- “Piping” (|) - uses | key sets parameters on output (e.g. “man | less” to see content in more usable form)
- “Redirection Operator” (>) sends output of a command on the left side to file named on right (if doesn’t exist, created, if does, overwritten); if double (>>) used, adds rather than replaces 

Useful Terminal Commands
- cd (change directory) - can be absolute or relative
- pwd (present working directory): show where you are now
- ls (list the contents of current directory), can be modified by 
- man + … (manual) will pull up overview of a command, including all available flags and what they do
- less (controls the amount of info shown to you), press space to move forward a full screen, or enter to move forward a line
- “cat” - reads contents of every file you provide and puts them together & dumps on screen (output is text)

GIT Notes
- git init: creates an initial git repository in whatever folder you're currently in
- git status: checks the status of the git repository (what files are currently tracked / untracked, what branch you're on, etc.) 
- git add: adds any files or directories to the git staging area (make untracked things tracked)
- git commit: commits all content in the git staging area, which adds ID, Signature, Timestamp, any Differences, and Message. Commit is permanent
- git log: shows commit history, including git 

- Hidden files or folders all start with . (eg .xyzfile), and can be viewed under "ls -a")
- git log ll (shows consolidated version of all commits), git log la (shows more detailed view of all commits)
- git uses labels: head (the most recent commit), master (the name for the very first branch)
- create new branches with the branch command (eg git branch git-notes) - (to see all existing branches type git branch)
- switch branches with checkout (then branch name)
